## Usage

Help for any commands can be displayed by specifying the command as an argument to memcached:help. Please consult the `memcached:help` command for any undocumented commands.

### Basic Usage

### create a memcached service

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:create <service> [--create-flags...]
```

flags:

- `-m|--memory MEMORY`: override the cache size (in MB, default to 64MB)
- `-C|--custom-env "USER=alpha;HOST=beta"`: semi-colon delimited environment variables to start the service with
- `-i|--image IMAGE`: the image name to start the service with
- `-I|--image-version IMAGE_VERSION`: the image version to start the service with
- `-p|--password PASSWORD`: override the user-level service password
- `-r|--root-password PASSWORD`: override the root-level service password

Create a memcached service named lolipop:

```shell
dokku memcached:create lolipop
```

You can also specify the image and image version to use for the service. It *must* be compatible with the memcached image. 

```shell
export MEMCACHED_IMAGE="memcached"
export MEMCACHED_IMAGE_VERSION="${PLUGIN_IMAGE_VERSION}"
dokku memcached:create lolipop
```

You can also specify custom environment variables to start the memcached service in semi-colon separated form. 

```shell
export MEMCACHED_CUSTOM_ENV="USER=alpha;HOST=beta"
dokku memcached:create lolipop
```

### print the service information

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:info <service> [--single-info-flag]
```

flags:

- `--config-dir`: show the service configuration directory
- `--data-dir`: show the service data directory
- `--dsn`: show the service DSN
- `--exposed-ports`: show service exposed ports
- `--id`: show the service container id
- `--internal-ip`: show the service internal ip
- `--links`: show the service app links
- `--service-root`: show the service root directory
- `--status`: show the service running status
- `--version`: show the service image version

Get connection information as follows:

```shell
dokku memcached:info lolipop
```

You can also retrieve a specific piece of service info via flags:

```shell
dokku memcached:info lolipop --config-dir
dokku memcached:info lolipop --data-dir
dokku memcached:info lolipop --dsn
dokku memcached:info lolipop --exposed-ports
dokku memcached:info lolipop --id
dokku memcached:info lolipop --internal-ip
dokku memcached:info lolipop --links
dokku memcached:info lolipop --service-root
dokku memcached:info lolipop --status
dokku memcached:info lolipop --version
```

### list all memcached services

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:list 
```

List all services:

```shell
dokku memcached:list
```

### print the most recent log(s) for this service

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:logs <service> [-t|--tail]
```

flags:

- `-t|--tail`: do not stop when end of the logs are reached and wait for additional output

You can tail logs for a particular service:

```shell
dokku memcached:logs lolipop
```

By default, logs will not be tailed, but you can do this with the --tail flag:

```shell
dokku memcached:logs lolipop --tail
```

### link the memcached service to the app

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:link <service> <app> [--link-flags...]
```

flags:

- `-a|--alias "BLUE_DATABASE"`: an alternative alias to use for linking to an app via environment variable
- `-q|--querystring "pool=5"`: ampersand delimited querystring arguments to append to the service link

A memcached service can be linked to a container. This will use native docker links via the docker-options plugin. Here we link it to our 'playground' app. 

> NOTE: this will restart your app

```shell
dokku memcached:link lolipop playground
```

The following environment variables will be set automatically by docker (not on the app itself, so they wonâ€™t be listed when calling dokku config):

```
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_LOLIPOP_NAME=/lolipop/DATABASE
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_LOLIPOP_PORT=tcp://172.17.0.1:11211
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_LOLIPOP_PORT_11211_TCP=tcp://172.17.0.1:11211
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_LOLIPOP_PORT_11211_TCP_PROTO=tcp
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_LOLIPOP_PORT_11211_TCP_PORT=11211
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_LOLIPOP_PORT_11211_TCP_ADDR=172.17.0.1
```

The following will be set on the linked application by default:

```
MEMCACHED_URL=memcached://lolipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-memcached-lolipop:11211/lolipop
```

The host exposed here only works internally in docker containers. If you want your container to be reachable from outside, you should use the 'expose' subcommand. Another service can be linked to your app:

```shell
dokku memcached:link other_service playground
```

It is possible to change the protocol for `MEMCACHED_URL` by setting the environment variable `MEMCACHED_DATABASE_SCHEME` on the app. Doing so will after linking will cause the plugin to think the service is not linked, and we advise you to unlink before proceeding. 

```shell
dokku config:set playground MEMCACHED_DATABASE_SCHEME=memcached2
dokku memcached:link lolipop playground
```

This will cause `MEMCACHED_URL` to be set as:

```
memcached2://lolipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-memcached-lolipop:11211/lolipop
```

### unlink the memcached service from the app

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:unlink <service> <app>
```

You can unlink a memcached service:

> NOTE: this will restart your app and unset related environment variables

```shell
dokku memcached:unlink lolipop playground
```

### Service Lifecycle

The lifecycle of each service can be managed through the following commands:

### connect to the service via the memcached connection tool

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:connect <service>
```

Connect to the service via the memcached connection tool:

```shell
dokku memcached:connect lolipop
```

### enter or run a command in a running memcached service container

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:enter <service>
```

A bash prompt can be opened against a running service. Filesystem changes will not be saved to disk. 

```shell
dokku memcached:enter lolipop
```

You may also run a command directly against the service. Filesystem changes will not be saved to disk. 

```shell
dokku memcached:enter lolipop touch /tmp/test
```

### expose a memcached service on custom port if provided (random port otherwise)

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:expose <service> <ports...>
```

Expose the service on the service's normal ports, allowing access to it from the public interface (`0.0.0.0`):

```shell
dokku memcached:expose lolipop 11211
```

### unexpose a previously exposed memcached service

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:unexpose <service>
```

Unexpose the service, removing access to it from the public interface (`0.0.0.0`):

```shell
dokku memcached:unexpose lolipop
```

### promote service <service> as MEMCACHED_URL in <app>

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:promote <service> <app>
```

If you have a memcached service linked to an app and try to link another memcached service another link environment variable will be generated automatically:

```
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_BLUE_URL=memcached://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-memcached-other-service:11211/other_service
```

You can promote the new service to be the primary one:

> NOTE: this will restart your app

```shell
dokku memcached:promote other_service playground
```

This will replace `MEMCACHED_URL` with the url from other_service and generate another environment variable to hold the previous value if necessary. You could end up with the following for example:

```
MEMCACHED_URL=memcached://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-memcached-other-service:11211/other_service
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_BLUE_URL=memcached://other_service:ANOTHER_PASSWORD@dokku-memcached-other-service:11211/other_service
DOKKU_MEMCACHED_SILVER_URL=memcached://lolipop:SOME_PASSWORD@dokku-memcached-lolipop:11211/lolipop
```

### start a previously stopped memcached service

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:start <service>
```

Start the service:

```shell
dokku memcached:start lolipop
```

### stop a running memcached service

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:stop <service>
```

Stop the service and the running container:

```shell
dokku memcached:stop lolipop
```

### graceful shutdown and restart of the memcached service container

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:restart <service>
```

Restart the service:

```shell
dokku memcached:restart lolipop
```

### upgrade service <service> to the specified versions

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:upgrade <service> [--upgrade-flags...]
```

flags:

- `-m|--memory MEMORY`: override the cache size (in MB, default to 64MB)
- `-C|--custom-env "USER=alpha;HOST=beta"`: semi-colon delimited environment variables to start the service with
- `-i|--image IMAGE`: the image name to start the service with
- `-I|--image-version IMAGE_VERSION`: the image version to start the service with
- `-R|--restart-apps "true"`: whether to force an app restart

You can upgrade an existing service to a new image or image-version:

```shell
dokku memcached:upgrade lolipop
```

### Service Automation

Service scripting can be executed using the following commands:

### list all memcached service links for a given app

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:app-links <app>
```

List all memcached services that are linked to the 'playground' app. 

```shell
dokku memcached:app-links playground
```

### check if the memcached service exists

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:exists <service>
```

Here we check if the lolipop memcached service exists. 

```shell
dokku memcached:exists lolipop
```

### check if the memcached service is linked to an app

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:linked <service> <app>
```

Here we check if the lolipop memcached service is linked to the 'playground' app. 

```shell
dokku memcached:linked lolipop playground
```

### list all apps linked to the memcached service

```shell
# usage
dokku memcached:links <service>
```

List all apps linked to the 'lolipop' memcached service. 

```shell
dokku memcached:links lolipop
```

### Disabling `docker pull` calls

If you wish to disable the `docker pull` calls that the plugin triggers, you may set the `MEMCACHED_DISABLE_PULL` environment variable to `true`. Once disabled, you will need to pull the service image you wish to deploy as shown in the `stderr` output.

Please ensure the proper images are in place when `docker pull` is disabled.
